lhc.indexer
===========

Search indexing thing for the 
[Large Hansard Collider](https://github.com/lizconlan/large-hansard-collider).

A little rough and ready, and decidedly weird to start working on this while 
the Collider's only half built but, but... Reasons. Honest.

## Oddities

Deliberately doesn't build the database as it assumes that the database has 
already been created and populated by the Collider.

## Assumptions

* Ruby 2.0.x
* Postgres 9.3.x
